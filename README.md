TITLE:PREDICTIVE MODELLING FOR REDUCING CUSTOMER CHURN IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning models. By identifying high-risk customers, the company aims to implement strategies to enhance customer retention, ultimately improving revenue and profitability.

Business Understanding
Customer churn significantly impacts revenue, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. Understanding and predicting churn allows the company to proactively address the needs and concerns of at-risk customers, thereby reducing churn rates and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Objectives
1.Data Preparation and Exploration: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric features.

2.Model Development: Build a baseline model using logistic regression and an advanced model using a decision tree classifier with hyperparameter tuning.

3.Model Evaluation and Comparison: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and identify the best-performing model.

4.Insights and Recommendations: Analyze feature importance, provide actionable insights, and develop strategies for customer retention.

5.Iterative Improvement: Continuously monitor and update the models with new data to maintain accuracy and adapt to changing customer behaviors.

Data Understanding
The dataset consists of various features related to customer usage and interactions with the service, including account length, usage metrics, service plans, and customer service calls. The target variable is churn, indicating whether a customer has left the service.

Modeling
Two models were developed and evaluated:

Logistic Regression Model: Served as the baseline model with an accuracy of 85.36%.
Decision Tree Model: An advanced model with hyperparameter tuning that achieved an accuracy of 93.76%.

Evaluation
The decision tree model outperformed the logistic regression model across all key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, indicating superior performance in predicting customer churn.

Recommendations
1.Leverage the Decision Tree Model: Use the model to identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

2.Analyze Feature Importance: Focus on influential features identified by the model to understand key drivers of churn.

3.Monitor and Update Models: Continuously monitor the modelâ€™s performance and update it with new data.

4.Implement Personalized Marketing: Develop personalized marketing campaigns targeting customers likely to churn with relevant offers.

5.Improve Product Development: Use insights from churn patterns to guide product enhancements and reduce churn rates.
